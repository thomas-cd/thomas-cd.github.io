	<h3> Image Compressor </h3>
		
	<p> I wrote a jpeg-like image compressor and decompressor
		in C. The program transforms an image from the
		RGB color space to the component video (Y, Pb,
		Pr), then with discrete cosign transformation to
		a, b, c, and d values. Finally it trims b, c, and
		d to the save space and packs it into a file
		format. The decompressor does this process in
		reverse. Message or email me to discuss this or
		see source code. </p>
