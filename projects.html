	<h2> Computer Science </h2>

	<h3> Noodle News </h3>

	<p> Noodle News is a news agrigator with bias filtering
		based on the source or manual filtering by source.
		It also allows for searching based on bias of
		source. Noodle news provides news from 17
		sources and shows headlines with images and
		descriptions. <a href="http://noodle-news.herokuapp.com/">Find it here. </a> </p>

	<h3> Image Compressor </h3>

	<p> I wrote a jpeg-like image compressor and decompressor
		in C. The program transforms an image from the
		RGB color space to the component video (Y, Pb,
		Pr), then with discrete cosign transformation to
		a, b, c, and d values. Finally it trims b, c, and
		d to the save space and packs it into a file
		format. The decompressor does this process in
		reverse. Message or email me to discuss this or
		see source code. </p>

	<h2> Mechanical </h2>

	<h3> Electric Car </h3>

	<p> I am an active participant on the Tufts Electric
		Racing team. We won 4th in 2019 and 6th in 2018
		at the Formula Hybrid Competition, all electric
		category. I have led teams in designing important
		parts of the car. </p>
	<p> My freshman year, I participated in a complete
		redesign of the suspension system. Our new
		suspension system was a resounding success,
		keeping the car several inches off the ground
		was also providing a comfortable ride. </p>
	<p> I also led a group that designed the fiberglass
		composite side pannel covers. I also assisted the
		team that designed the new nose cone. We did all
		the design, molds, layups, and attachment in
		house. </p>
	<p> My freshman year, I learned how to assemble the
		cooling system. I designed a custom mount for the
		pump and attachments for the radiator. Then, my
		sophmore year, I led the maintanace of our car's
		cooling system. </p>
	<p> My sophmore year, I led a team that redesigned the
		seat tub, creating a new, better looking and
		more comfortable riding experience. Our new seat
		has new alcantara covered cushions and an improved
		design for easier driver egress. </p>
	<p> I also started participating in the electrical side of
		the car my sophmore year. I did general work like
		wiring and crimping. Additionally, I also handled
		mechanical-like electrical tasks. For example, I
		redesigned the battery mount to be more secure,
		usable, and robust. I also was tasked with
		mounting an odd solenoid and grounding all metal
		components to the chassis. </p>

	<h3> Tufts Bikes </h3>

	<p> I am vice president for Tufts' community bike share.
		We maintain a fleet of around 30 bikes that
		students can check out from the library for free.
		In addition, we also offer weekly mechanics hours
		where we help members of the community fix their
		bikes. I was treasurer starting my freshman year,
		doubling the budget, then nearly a doubling it
		again my sophmore year. Starting my sophmore year,
		I was a shift lead, the most senior and
		responsible mechanic for one of the mechanics
		hours. I opened the shop, fixed bikes, and taught
		new mechanics how to fix bikes. </p>

	<h3> Play Structure </h3>

	<p> In high school, I build a large wooden structure
		similar to what you might find at a park.
		The structure included a two story tower and
		a tire swing. I designed it, considering the load
		it would have to withstand, then assembled it with
		the help of my brothers. </p>
