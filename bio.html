        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p> I'm a sophmore Tufts student interested in a wide
                variety of academic subjects. I enjoy Math, Chemistry,
                Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Economics,
                and many others. But how did it come to this?</p>
        <p> I was born and raised in California. I grew up with an
                older sister and two younger brothers. I learned
                cook at a young age and still enjoy cooking to things
                day. My father inspired my interest in academics because
                of his passion for and interest in all subjects. I also
                participated in Boy Scouts, acheiving the rank of Eagle
                Scout.</p>
        <p> Now I'm a Quidditch player who fixes bikes and
                take as many classes as I can. </p>
